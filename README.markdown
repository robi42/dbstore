Hibernate Module
================

* This module enables Helma NG to use Hibernate as its ORM/persistence layer.
* For a reference implementation have a look at the app located in the helma-ng/apps/hibernate-blog/ dir.
* Especially its README and the contents of its config, db/mappings, app/models and app/controllers dirs should be of interest.
